HIGH LEVEL APP OVERVIEW

    -Vue apps
    Layout and general functionality:
    There are 3 main components
        1. Calendar on the left 3/4 part of window
            1. Allows user to cycle through months
            2. Will display days that have an entry
                -DONE - api call to backend to retrieve entry objects
                -DONE - store as state in VUEX
                -DONE - hardcoded calendar indicator on all days
                -DONE - indicator should only appear on days with an entry

            3. Clicking on a day with an entry will take me to my django
                time_entry_detail view that allows user to edit a single day

        2. Dashboards underneath calendar and form
            1. will render this out directly from django
                -total overtime hours
                -total base hours
                -total days worked

        3. Form for user to capture time data
            -will have global state in vuex store that tracks the user selected day
                mvp1 - Done
                -once a day is selected, form line appears with date prepopulated allowing
                    user to capture their time entry
                mvp2
                -will allow user to select multiple days. only:
                    - DONE - one time entry allowed (ie 2 hours for every day)
                    - DONE - Clear Vue store form state after submital
                    - what is the proper way to sync up store state db.
                        *not really sure but will try this
                        DONE - step 1. submit form to db
                        DONE - step 2. write to db
                        step 3. return response to vue
                        step 4. based on response alert user to either success or failure
                            step 4a. if failure load any error messages for user
                            step 4b. rerun step 1
                        step 5. successful call write to vuex store
                        step 6. clear form state in vuex
                        -do i make api call to fetch updated data, or just add new entry to vue store
                    - need to allow user to exclude weekends for time capture
                mvp3
                -will allow user to select a day with an entry already capture
                    and route them to my view thats created to modfify a day

            1. Button to allow adding an extra form row for multi day entry
            2. Button to remove a row if an extra row is not needed

        4. VUEX store to manage state
            Write operations:
                1. Create time entry
                2. Edit time entry (is this needed - outsourcing to already created view)
            Read Operations:
                1. Get time entry (query database for user entries that month at application load)


ADMIN DASHBOARD APP:

1. Settings View
    - Select pay range ex - Aug 26 starts month september 25th ends month
2. Main View
    a. Pay period selection
    b. Displays list of employees and if their time is approved - card with approved and hours for period
        - clicking the employees card brings up a table with all of the employees entries
        - each entry has click box to approve time
        - once time is approved, it becomes locked, and user unable to edit



4. Generate PDF report for the approved pay cycle, sending to person doing payroll
    - give admin some options for report generation
        - pay cycle
        - employees to include
        - who to send it to
